# Machine Learning Data Prep:  Handling outliers using Python

### Summary
This presentation is about data preparation for machine learning.  It begins 
with a general introduction of machine learning.  Then briefly introduces 
the importance of data preparation and handling outliers with Python as  
a specific example.  

The presentation was delevered twice to Orlando area organizations.  
First, to the [Orlando Machine Learning and Data Science Meetup Group (OMLDS)](https://www.meetup.com/Orlando-MLDS/) 
on October 26, 2021 during an online Lunch and Learn.  
Second, as part of the machine learning track of [SQL Saturday Orlando 2022](https://sqlsaturday.com/2022-10-08-sqlsaturday1030/)
on October 8, 2022.

Data preparation for machine learning is essential.  Outliers are a a fundamental 
concept to understand in machine learning and statistics.  This presentation 
uses EPA fuel efficiency data as a real world example of how outliers can lead 
us to identify new and interesting groups/subsets within data.  

Small snippets of Python code are highlighted in the presentation slides.  The
full code is in the notebook within this repository.  For those seeking to 
grow python visual graphing skills, the code shows a method using Seaborn 
regplots overlayed with scatter plots to highlight outliers with a different 
color, something not inherent in the Seaborn regplot.
